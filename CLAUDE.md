# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

Authenticheck — a rule-based authenticity checker for second-hand Balenciaga bags
(v1: City / Motorcycle). Product decisions live in `context/foundation/`:
`prd.md` (FRs, business rule, non-goals), `tech-stack.md` (starter hand-off),
`shape-notes.md` (discovery trail). Brand knowledge is data, not code: rules and
checklist questions belong in config files consumed by a generic engine.

## Conventions

- API routes: uppercase `GET`/`POST` exports; validate input with `z` from `astro/zod`
  (bundled with Astro; `astro:schema` is deprecated and fails the `no-deprecated` lint rule — the current auth routes still cast `formData` values and are the exception, not the pattern).
- API routes return errors as `{ error: { code, message, context? } }` with the matching HTTP status.
  `code` is a stable SCREAMING_SNAKE identifier (`UNAUTHENTICATED`, `INVALID_INPUT`, …); validation details
  go inside `context`, never as a sibling `issues` field. Never `{ error: string }`.
- Supabase: migrations in `supabase/migrations/` as `YYYYMMDDHHmmss_short_description.sql`
  (directory not created yet); every new table gets RLS with per-operation, per-role policies —
  the PRD's "each user sees only their own verifications" depends on it.
- Create on first need: `src/types.ts` (shared entities/DTOs), `src/lib/services/` (extracted
  business logic), `src/components/hooks/` (React hooks). None exist yet.
- React: no Next.js directives (`"use client"` etc.).

## Architecture

Astro 6 with `output: "server"` — every page and API route is rendered on demand; do not add `prerender = true` to an API route.
React 19 only for interactive islands; Astro components for layout/static content.
Tailwind 4 + shadcn/ui (`src/components/ui/`, "new-york"); merge classes with `cn()` from `@/lib/utils`.

**Auth is optional at runtime.** `SUPABASE_URL` / `SUPABASE_KEY` are declared `optional: true`
in `astro.config.mjs` (`astro:env/server`). `createClient()` in `src/lib/supabase.ts` returns
`null` when they are missing, and `src/lib/config-status.ts` turns that into a "not configured"
banner. Consequences: every API route and page must handle a `null` client; build and CI pass
without secrets; misconfiguration surfaces only at runtime.

Request flow: `src/middleware.ts` resolves the Supabase user on every request into
`context.locals.user` (typed in `src/env.d.ts`) and redirects unauthenticated requests whose
path starts with an entry in `PROTECTED_ROUTES` to `/auth/signin`. Add every new
authenticated route there. Auth endpoints: `src/pages/api/auth/{signin,signup,signout}.ts`
(form POST → redirect with `?error=`); pages under `src/pages/auth/`.

## Commands

- `npm run dev` — dev server on Cloudflare workerd; secrets from `.dev.vars` (Node scripts read `.env`)
- `npm run build` — SSR build via `@astrojs/cloudflare`; run before any `wrangler` command
- `npx astro sync` — generates `.astro/` types; required once after a fresh clone or `npm run lint` fails with ~20 unresolved-type errors (CI runs it explicitly)
- `npm run lint` / `lint:fix` — ESLint (strictTypeChecked + Prettier as a lint rule: formatting errors fail lint)
- `npx supabase start` — local Supabase (Docker); Studio at http://localhost:54323
- No test runner is configured yet. The PRD requires an end-to-end test of the main
  verification path — pick and wire a runner before writing tests.

Wrangler (Worker `authenticheck`). Production deploys come from Workers Builds on `main`; CI never deploys.

- Agent-safe: `npm run build && npx wrangler versions upload --message "…" --preview-alias <name>`, `npx wrangler deploy --dry-run`, `npx wrangler deployments status`, `npx wrangler tail --format pretty --status error`
- Human-only: `npx wrangler deploy`, `npx wrangler rollback`, `npx wrangler secret put`, `wrangler login`, plan upgrades
- `dist/server/wrangler.json` is what deploys, not `wrangler.jsonc` — build first.
- `compatibility_date` ceiling is `2026-05-14` (pinned workerd); raise only with an adapter/wrangler upgrade.

Pre-commit (husky + lint-staged): `eslint --fix` on `*.{ts,tsx,astro}`, `prettier --write` on `*.{json,css,md}`.
CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs lint + build on push/PR to `main`, Node 22 (`.nvmrc` 22.14; local Node 24 also works).

## 10xDevs AI Toolkit - Module 2, Lesson 2

Turn one roadmap item into the first implementation cycle with the **change planning chain**:

```
/10x-roadmap -> /10x-new -> /10x-plan -> /10x-plan-review -> /10x-implement
```

`/10x-new`, `/10x-plan`, `/10x-plan-review`, and `/10x-implement` are the lesson focus. `/10x-frame` and `/10x-research` are not required rituals here; they are escalation paths introduced in the next lesson.

### Task Router - Where to start

| Skill | Use it when |
| --- | --- |
| **Change setup (lesson focus)** | |
| `/10x-new <change-id>` | You selected a roadmap item and need a stable change folder. Creates `context/changes/<change-id>/change.md` so planning, implementation, progress, commits, and later review all share one identity. Use AFTER roadmap selection, BEFORE `/10x-plan`. |
| **Planning (lesson focus)** | |
| `/10x-plan <change-id>` | You have a change folder and need a reviewable implementation plan. Reads roadmap context, foundation docs, codebase evidence, and any existing change notes; writes `plan.md` and `plan-brief.md` with phases, file contracts, success criteria, and `## Progress`. |
| **Plan readiness (lesson focus)** | |
| `/10x-plan-review <change-id>` | You have `plan.md` and need a light pre-code readiness check. Use it to catch missing end state, weak contracts, malformed progress, scope drift, or blind spots before code changes begin. |
| **Implementation (lesson focus)** | |
| `/10x-implement <change-id> phase <n>` | You have an approved plan and want to execute one phase with verification, manual gate, commit ritual, and SHA write-back to `## Progress`. |
| **Lifecycle closure** | |
| `/10x-archive <change-id>` | A change is merged or intentionally closed. Move it out of active `context/changes/` into archive state. |

### How the chain hands off

- `/10x-new` creates the durable change identity.
- `/10x-plan` turns that identity into an implementation contract.
- `/10x-plan-review` checks the plan before the agent mutates code.
- `/10x-implement` executes one planned phase, verifies, asks for manual confirmation when needed, commits, and records progress.

### Lesson boundaries

- Plan is the default router after roadmap selection. Start with `/10x-plan` unless the problem is unclear or external evidence is blocking.
- Do not run `/10x-frame + /10x-research` as ceremony for every change.
- Do not turn this lesson into a full end-to-end product build. A checkpoint with a planned and partially or fully implemented stream is valid.
- Code review of the implemented diff belongs to Lesson 3 via `/10x-impl-review`.
- Lifecycle closure via `/10x-archive` after a change is merged or intentionally closed.

### Paths used by this lesson

- `context/foundation/roadmap.md` - upstream roadmap
- `context/changes/<change-id>/change.md` - change identity
- `context/changes/<change-id>/plan.md` - implementation contract
- `context/changes/<change-id>/plan-brief.md` - compressed handoff
- `context/foundation/lessons.md` - recurring rules and pitfalls
- `docs/reference/contract-surfaces.md` - load-bearing names registry

Skills must not write to `context/archive/`. Archived changes are immutable; if a resolved target path starts with `context/archive/`, abort with: "This change is archived. Open a new change with `/10x-new` instead."
