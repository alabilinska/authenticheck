# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

Authenticheck — a rule-based authenticity checker for second-hand Balenciaga bags
(v1: Classic City medium with classic hardware). Product decisions live in `context/foundation/`:
`prd.md` (FRs, business rule, non-goals), `tech-stack.md` (starter hand-off),
`shape-notes.md` (discovery trail). Brand knowledge is data, not code: rules and
checklist questions belong in config files consumed by a generic engine.

## Conventions

- API routes: uppercase `GET`/`POST` exports; validate input with `z` from `astro/zod`
  (bundled with Astro; `astro:schema` is deprecated and fails the `no-deprecated` lint rule — the current auth routes still cast `formData` values and are the exception, not the pattern).
- API routes return errors as `{ error: { code, message, context? } }` with the matching HTTP status.
  `code` is a stable SCREAMING_SNAKE identifier (`UNAUTHENTICATED`, `INVALID_INPUT`, …); validation details
  go inside `context`, never as a sibling `issues` field. Never `{ error: string }`.
- Supabase: migrations in `supabase/migrations/` as `YYYYMMDDHHmmss_short_description.sql`
  (directory not created yet); every new table gets RLS with per-operation, per-role policies —
  the PRD's "each user sees only their own verifications" depends on it.
- Shared entities/DTOs live in `src/types.ts`, extracted business logic in `src/lib/services/`;
  create `src/components/hooks/` (React hooks) on first need.
- Tag knowledge lives in `src/data/balenciaga-classic-city/knowledge.json` (source: `balenciaga-city-tag-rules.md` —
  change the rules document first, then the JSON) and is evaluated by the pure engine in
  `src/lib/services/tag-validation/`; its tests encode the rules document's test set.
- React: no Next.js directives (`"use client"` etc.).
- Tests follow `context/foundation/test-plan.md` (risk map, rollout phases, cookbook §6) — read it before writing or changing any test.

## Architecture

Astro 6 with `output: "server"` — every page and API route is rendered on demand; do not add `prerender = true` to an API route.
React 19 only for interactive islands; Astro components for layout/static content.
Tailwind 4 + shadcn/ui (`src/components/ui/`, "new-york"); merge classes with `cn()` from `@/lib/utils`.

**Auth is optional at runtime.** `SUPABASE_URL` / `SUPABASE_KEY` are declared `optional: true`
in `astro.config.mjs` (`astro:env/server`). `createClient()` in `src/lib/supabase.ts` returns
`null` when they are missing, and `src/lib/config-status.ts` turns that into a "not configured"
banner. Consequences: every API route and page must handle a `null` client; build and CI pass
without secrets; misconfiguration surfaces only at runtime.

Request flow: `src/middleware.ts` resolves the Supabase user on every request into
`context.locals.user` (typed in `src/env.d.ts`) and redirects unauthenticated requests whose
path starts with an entry in `PROTECTED_ROUTES` to `/auth/signin`. Add every new
authenticated route there. Auth endpoints: `src/pages/api/auth/{signin,signup,signout,forgot-password,reset-password}.ts`
(form POST → redirect with `?error=`); pages under `src/pages/auth/`. Password reset: the default Supabase email
link lands on `GET /api/auth/confirm?code=…` (PKCE — works only in the browser that requested the reset);
`?token_hash=…&type=recovery` is also handled, for a customised "Reset password" template. Redirect URLs must list
`/api/auth/confirm` (README); shared logic in `src/lib/services/password-reset.ts`.

## Commands

- `npm run dev` — dev server on Cloudflare workerd; secrets from `.dev.vars` (Node scripts read `.env`)
- `npm run build` — SSR build via `@astrojs/cloudflare`; run before any `wrangler` command
- `npx astro sync` — generates `.astro/` types; required once after a fresh clone or `npm run lint` fails with ~20 unresolved-type errors (CI runs it explicitly)
- `npm run lint` / `lint:fix` — ESLint (strictTypeChecked + Prettier as a lint rule: formatting errors fail lint)
- `npx supabase start` — local Supabase (Docker); Studio at http://localhost:54323
- `npm test` / `npm run test:watch` — Vitest unit tests (`src/**/*.test.ts`, node environment, plain config without
  Astro's Vite setup); one file: `npx vitest run src/lib/services/tag-validation/evaluate.test.ts`
- `npm run typecheck` — `astro check`
- `npm run test:e2e` — Playwright end-to-end test of the main path (`e2e/*.spec.ts`) against `npm run dev` on :4321;
  needs `E2E_EMAIL` / `E2E_PASSWORD` of a test account in `.dev.vars` (skipped without them); not run in CI

Wrangler (Worker `authenticheck`). Production deploys come from Workers Builds on `main`; CI never deploys.

- Agent-safe: `npm run build && npx wrangler versions upload --message "…" --preview-alias <name>`, `npx wrangler deploy --dry-run`, `npx wrangler deployments status`, `npx wrangler tail --format pretty --status error`
- Human-only: `npx wrangler deploy`, `npx wrangler rollback`, `npx wrangler secret put`, `wrangler login`, plan upgrades
- `dist/server/wrangler.json` is what deploys, not `wrangler.jsonc` — build first.
- `compatibility_date` ceiling is `2026-05-14` (pinned workerd); raise only with an adapter/wrangler upgrade.

Pre-commit (husky + lint-staged): `eslint --fix` on `*.{ts,tsx,astro}`, `prettier --write` on `*.{json,css,md}`.
CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs lint, type check, unit tests and build on push/PR to `main`, Node 22 (`.nvmrc` 22.14; local Node 24 also works).

## 10xDevs AI Toolkit - Module 3, Lesson 2

Lesson 2 is about **writing tests that actually protect code** — not just maximise coverage. The oracle problem and vibe-testing anti-patterns explain why LLM-generated tests fail on real code; the risk-first quality contract from Lesson 1 is the fix.

```
context/foundation/test-plan.md (§3 Phased Rollout)
        │
        ▼  (one rollout phase at a time)
   /10x-research  ──►  research.md  (oracle source: what code should do, not what it does)
        │
        ▼
   /10x-plan  ──►  plan.md  (cost × signal, two-layer strategy, ordered phases)
        │
        ▼
   /10x-implement  or  /10x-tdd   ──►  working tests + §6 cookbook update
```

`/10x-tdd` is an **optional test-first mode**, not a replacement for the chain. It reads the same `plan.md`, writes to the same `## Progress` section, and covers the same phases as `/10x-implement`. Use it only when you can name the first failing assertion before writing any code.

### Task Router — Where to start

| Skill / Prompt | Use it when |
| --- | --- |
| `/10x-research` | Before writing any test for a risk. Research produces the oracle — what behaviour a test must prove — from sources (PRD, tech-stack, docs), not from the implementation shape. Also reveals whether a risk is already covered or has two separate faces (one safe, one real). |
| `/10x-plan` | Research is done. Plan decomposes the risk into ordered phases: environment setup first, then rules that depend on it, then hermetic stubs for failures that real infra cannot trigger, then cookbook update. Each phase names the behaviour it asserts and the regression it catches. |
| `/10x-implement` | Default executor for plan phases. Use for environment setup, existing code, scaffolding, and any phase where you cannot define a red test before writing code. |
| `/10x-tdd` | Optional. Use instead of `/10x-implement` for a phase where you can name the first red test in one sentence. Agent writes the failing test first, then the minimal code to green it, then refactors. Stops at the assertion before touching the implementation — that pause is the point. |
| `m3l2-ad-hoc-testing` prompt | You have a single file and want tests now, without the full research→plan→implement cycle. The prompt forces oracle-from-sources (reads PRD + TECH_STACK before asserting), behavioural assertions, edge cases from risk, and a regression table. Use it knowing you are trading depth for speed. |

### When to use `/10x-tdd` vs `/10x-implement`

The deciding question: *Can you name the first red test in one sentence?*

Good conditions for `/10x-tdd`:
- "promuje wyłącznie drafty w stanie `accepted`, a `pending`/`rejected` nigdy nie trafiają do talii"
- "zwraca `ok: true` i loguje `orphan_review_state`, gdy upsert stanu powtórek padnie w trakcie zapisu"
- "zwraca 401, gdy użytkownik nie ma dostępu do kursu"
- "resetuje interwał powtórki do jednego dnia, gdy ocena wynosi 0"

Each of these names an observable outcome, not an internal detail. If you cannot produce a sentence like this, stay on `/10x-implement` or return to `/10x-research`.

`/10x-tdd` is **not suited** for: environment setup, CI/CD config, documentation, thin wiring where the test would just rewrite the implementation, or a spike where you are still discovering the contract.

You can mix both modes in one plan:

```
/10x-implement <change-id> phase 1   # environment
/10x-tdd       <change-id> phase 2   # contract (new code)
/10x-tdd       <change-id> phase 3   # contract (API endpoint)
/10x-implement <change-id> phase 4   # cookbook + plan sync
```

Both write progress to the same `## Progress` section in `plan.md`.

### Two-layer test strategy (cost × signal)

For each risk, pick the **cheapest test that gives a real signal**. Do not default to e2e "because it's safest", and do not chase coverage percentage.

| Layer | When to use | When NOT to use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Integration (real DB / real infra) | The rule involves DB constraints, cascades, real SQL, or unique constraints that a mock would lie about. | Auth flows gated by RLS that belong to a separate phase; anything where setup cost exceeds signal value. |
| Hermetic (stub client) | Partial failures that real infra cannot trigger easily (e.g. second operation in a sequence fails). | Rules that depend on actual DB state — a stub will lie about constraint violations and cascades. |

A non-atomic save sequence (multiple independent operations without a transaction) means: write hermetic tests for partial-failure branches, not integration tests that force a mid-sequence error.

### Oracle rules

- The oracle — what the code *should* do — must come from sources: PRD, docs, tech-stack constraints, domain knowledge. It must **not** come from reading the implementation.
- If the implementation has a bug, copying its output as the expected value produces a mirror test that passes against the bug.
- When sources do not resolve the expected behaviour unambiguously, **stop and ask** rather than guessing.
- Research's job is to surface the oracle before any test is written.

### Vibe-testing anti-patterns to avoid

| Anti-pattern | How it looks | What to do instead |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mirror implementation | Assertion computes the expected value with the same logic as the tested code. | Assert against a value derived from the oracle (PRD / domain rule), not from the implementation. |
| Happy paths only | Tests only pass valid inputs; edge cases absent. | Add at least one edge case per risk: `null`, empty, dependency error, invalid input. |
| Redundant copies | Six nearly identical tests checking the same absence of a sentinel. | One parameterised test (`it.each`) per property; each test catches a different regression. |

### Mutation testing (Stryker) — selective quality gate

Coverage says "this line was executed". Mutation score says "would a test fail if I broke this line?" Use Stryker as a **selective gate** after a risk phase, not as a CI gate on every commit.

Workflow:
1. Tests pass for the risk phase.
2. Run `npx stryker run --mutate "path/to/file.ts"` (narrow scope to the changed module).
3. Open the HTML report; find survived mutants.
4. For each survived mutant ask: "Would this change hurt a user or the business?"
   - Yes → add an assertion that kills the mutant.
   - No (equivalent mutant or cosmetic change) → ignore consciously.
5. Do not chase 100% mutation score. A test that pins implementation details to kill a cosmetic mutant is itself a vibe test.

The integration gate can stay **ad hoc** (not on every commit) when running local infra is expensive. Mark it accordingly in `test-plan.md §4`.

### Lesson boundaries

- Do not configure hooks, hook lifecycle, or debugging hooks. That is Lesson 3.
- Do not configure MCP servers, Playwright API, e2e code, or multimodal scenario code. That is Lesson 4.
- Do not run the bug-to-fix-to-regression-test workflow. That is Lesson 5.
- Do not author CI/CD pipelines from scratch. That is Module 1 Lesson 5 / Module 2 Lesson 5.
- Do not run `/10x-test-plan` to change the risk strategy. That is Lesson 1. Use `/10x-test-plan --status` to read current state.
- Do not write tests without a research step unless using the ad-hoc prompt with full awareness of its trade-offs.

### Paths used by this lesson

- `context/foundation/test-plan.md` — §3 rollout state; §6 cookbook (filled in as phases ship)
- `context/changes/<change-id>/research.md` — oracle source per rollout phase
- `context/changes/<change-id>/plan.md` — ordered phases with `## Progress` as execution state
- `.claude/prompts/m3l2-ad-hoc-testing.md` — ad-hoc file-level testing prompt
