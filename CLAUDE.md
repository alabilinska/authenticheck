# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

Authenticheck — a rule-based authenticity checker for second-hand Balenciaga bags
(v1: Classic City medium with classic hardware). Product decisions live in `context/foundation/`:
`prd.md` (FRs, business rule, non-goals), `tech-stack.md` (starter hand-off),
`shape-notes.md` (discovery trail). Brand knowledge is data, not code: rules and
checklist questions belong in config files consumed by a generic engine.

## Conventions

- API routes: uppercase `GET`/`POST` exports; validate input with `z` from `astro/zod`
  (bundled with Astro; `astro:schema` is deprecated and fails the `no-deprecated` lint rule — the current auth routes still cast `formData` values and are the exception, not the pattern).
- API routes return errors as `{ error: { code, message, context? } }` with the matching HTTP status.
  `code` is a stable SCREAMING_SNAKE identifier (`UNAUTHENTICATED`, `INVALID_INPUT`, …); validation details
  go inside `context`, never as a sibling `issues` field. Never `{ error: string }`.
- Supabase: migrations in `supabase/migrations/` as `YYYYMMDDHHmmss_short_description.sql`
  (directory not created yet); every new table gets RLS with per-operation, per-role policies —
  the PRD's "each user sees only their own verifications" depends on it.
- Shared entities/DTOs live in `src/types.ts`, extracted business logic in `src/lib/services/`;
  create `src/components/hooks/` (React hooks) on first need.
- Tag knowledge lives in `src/data/balenciaga-classic-city/knowledge.json` (source: `balenciaga-city-tag-rules.md` —
  change the rules document first, then the JSON) and is evaluated by the pure engine in
  `src/lib/services/tag-validation/`; its tests encode the rules document's test set.
- React: no Next.js directives (`"use client"` etc.).

## Architecture

Astro 6 with `output: "server"` — every page and API route is rendered on demand; do not add `prerender = true` to an API route.
React 19 only for interactive islands; Astro components for layout/static content.
Tailwind 4 + shadcn/ui (`src/components/ui/`, "new-york"); merge classes with `cn()` from `@/lib/utils`.

**Auth is optional at runtime.** `SUPABASE_URL` / `SUPABASE_KEY` are declared `optional: true`
in `astro.config.mjs` (`astro:env/server`). `createClient()` in `src/lib/supabase.ts` returns
`null` when they are missing, and `src/lib/config-status.ts` turns that into a "not configured"
banner. Consequences: every API route and page must handle a `null` client; build and CI pass
without secrets; misconfiguration surfaces only at runtime.

Request flow: `src/middleware.ts` resolves the Supabase user on every request into
`context.locals.user` (typed in `src/env.d.ts`) and redirects unauthenticated requests whose
path starts with an entry in `PROTECTED_ROUTES` to `/auth/signin`. Add every new
authenticated route there. Auth endpoints: `src/pages/api/auth/{signin,signup,signout,forgot-password,reset-password}.ts`
(form POST → redirect with `?error=`); pages under `src/pages/auth/`. Password reset: the default Supabase email
link lands on `GET /api/auth/confirm?code=…` (PKCE — works only in the browser that requested the reset);
`?token_hash=…&type=recovery` is also handled, for a customised "Reset password" template. Redirect URLs must list
`/api/auth/confirm` (README); shared logic in `src/lib/services/password-reset.ts`.

## Commands

- `npm run dev` — dev server on Cloudflare workerd; secrets from `.dev.vars` (Node scripts read `.env`)
- `npm run build` — SSR build via `@astrojs/cloudflare`; run before any `wrangler` command
- `npx astro sync` — generates `.astro/` types; required once after a fresh clone or `npm run lint` fails with ~20 unresolved-type errors (CI runs it explicitly)
- `npm run lint` / `lint:fix` — ESLint (strictTypeChecked + Prettier as a lint rule: formatting errors fail lint)
- `npx supabase start` — local Supabase (Docker); Studio at http://localhost:54323
- `npm test` / `npm run test:watch` — Vitest unit tests (`src/**/*.test.ts`, node environment, plain config without
  Astro's Vite setup); one file: `npx vitest run src/lib/services/tag-validation/evaluate.test.ts`
- `npm run typecheck` — `astro check`
- `npm run test:e2e` — Playwright end-to-end test of the main path (`e2e/*.spec.ts`) against `npm run dev` on :4321;
  needs `E2E_EMAIL` / `E2E_PASSWORD` of a test account in `.dev.vars` (skipped without them); not run in CI

Wrangler (Worker `authenticheck`). Production deploys come from Workers Builds on `main`; CI never deploys.

- Agent-safe: `npm run build && npx wrangler versions upload --message "…" --preview-alias <name>`, `npx wrangler deploy --dry-run`, `npx wrangler deployments status`, `npx wrangler tail --format pretty --status error`
- Human-only: `npx wrangler deploy`, `npx wrangler rollback`, `npx wrangler secret put`, `wrangler login`, plan upgrades
- `dist/server/wrangler.json` is what deploys, not `wrangler.jsonc` — build first.
- `compatibility_date` ceiling is `2026-05-14` (pinned workerd); raise only with an adapter/wrangler upgrade.

Pre-commit (husky + lint-staged): `eslint --fix` on `*.{ts,tsx,astro}`, `prettier --write` on `*.{json,css,md}`.
CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs lint, type check, unit tests and build on push/PR to `main`, Node 22 (`.nvmrc` 22.14; local Node 24 also works).

## 10xDevs AI Toolkit - Module 2, Lesson 5

Scale the single-change cycle into parallel work with **worktrees, goal-directed delegation, and multi-session orchestration**:

```
worktree per change -> /goal or claude -p -> PR -> review -> merge
```

The lesson focus is safe throughput: isolated contexts, choosing the right execution mode, and capping parallelism at review capacity.

### Task Router - Where to start

| Skill | Use it when |
| --- | --- |
| **Code isolation** | |
| `git worktree add` | You need a separate working directory for a parallel change. One change per worktree, one fresh agent context per worktree. |
| **Complex changes** | |
| `/10x-implement <change-id> phase <n>` | The change has multiple phases, needs manual gates, or benefits from interactive decision-making during execution. |
| **Simple changes** | |
| `/goal` | You have a clear, bounded task and want goal-directed delegation. The agent works autonomously toward the stated goal with a stop condition. |
| `claude -p` | You want headless execution for a well-defined task. The Ralph Wiggum loop (run, check, retry) is the universal autonomous pattern. |
| **Multi-session orchestration** | |
| Superset / Conductor / Antigravity / VS Code Agent View | You are running multiple agent sessions in parallel and need visibility, coordination, or session management across them. |

### Parallel work rules

- One change per worktree or isolated workspace. One fresh agent context per change.
- Choose interactive `/10x-implement` for complex changes, `/goal` or `claude -p` for simple ones.
- Parallelism is capped by review capacity. More agents without review means more unreviewed code, not higher throughput.
- The quality pain from faster shipping is intentional — it bridges into Module 3 testing gates.

### Lesson boundaries

- Do not reteach interactive `/10x-implement` or `/10x-impl-review`; those are Lessons 2 and 3.
- Do not introduce testing strategy here. The quality pain is the motivation for Module 3.
- Worktrees are a mechanism for isolation, not the topic of a full git tutorial.

### Paths used by this lesson

- `context/changes/<change-id>/` - active change folder
- `context/changes/<change-id>/plan.md` - implementation input for any execution mode

Skills must not write to `context/archive/`. Archived changes are immutable; if a resolved target path starts with `context/archive/`, abort with: "This change is archived. Open a new change with `/10x-new` instead."
