# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

Authenticheck — a rule-based authenticity checker for second-hand Balenciaga bags
(v1: Classic City medium with classic hardware). Product decisions live in `context/foundation/`:
`prd.md` (FRs, business rule, non-goals), `tech-stack.md` (starter hand-off),
`shape-notes.md` (discovery trail). Brand knowledge is data, not code: rules and
checklist questions belong in config files consumed by a generic engine.

## Conventions

- API routes: uppercase `GET`/`POST` exports; validate input with `z` from `astro/zod`
  (bundled with Astro; `astro:schema` is deprecated and fails the `no-deprecated` lint rule — the current auth routes still cast `formData` values and are the exception, not the pattern).
- API routes return errors as `{ error: { code, message, context? } }` with the matching HTTP status.
  `code` is a stable SCREAMING_SNAKE identifier (`UNAUTHENTICATED`, `INVALID_INPUT`, …); validation details
  go inside `context`, never as a sibling `issues` field. Never `{ error: string }`.
- Supabase: migrations in `supabase/migrations/` as `YYYYMMDDHHmmss_short_description.sql`
  (directory not created yet); every new table gets RLS with per-operation, per-role policies —
  the PRD's "each user sees only their own verifications" depends on it.
- Shared entities/DTOs live in `src/types.ts`, extracted business logic in `src/lib/services/`;
  create `src/components/hooks/` (React hooks) on first need.
- Tag knowledge lives in `src/data/balenciaga-classic-city/knowledge.json` (source: `balenciaga-city-tag-rules.md` —
  change the rules document first, then the JSON) and is evaluated by the pure engine in
  `src/lib/services/tag-validation/`; its tests encode the rules document's test set.
- React: no Next.js directives (`"use client"` etc.).
- Tests follow `context/foundation/test-plan.md` (risk map, rollout phases, cookbook §6) — read it before writing or changing any test.

## Architecture

Astro 6 with `output: "server"` — every page and API route is rendered on demand; do not add `prerender = true` to an API route.
React 19 only for interactive islands; Astro components for layout/static content.
Tailwind 4 + shadcn/ui (`src/components/ui/`, "new-york"); merge classes with `cn()` from `@/lib/utils`.

**Auth is optional at runtime.** `SUPABASE_URL` / `SUPABASE_KEY` are declared `optional: true`
in `astro.config.mjs` (`astro:env/server`). `createClient()` in `src/lib/supabase.ts` returns
`null` when they are missing, and `src/lib/config-status.ts` turns that into a "not configured"
banner. Consequences: every API route and page must handle a `null` client; build and CI pass
without secrets; misconfiguration surfaces only at runtime.

Request flow: `src/middleware.ts` resolves the Supabase user on every request into
`context.locals.user` (typed in `src/env.d.ts`) and redirects unauthenticated requests whose
path starts with an entry in `PROTECTED_ROUTES` to `/auth/signin`. Add every new
authenticated route there. Auth endpoints: `src/pages/api/auth/{signin,signup,signout,forgot-password,reset-password}.ts`
(form POST → redirect with `?error=`); pages under `src/pages/auth/`. Password reset: the default Supabase email
link lands on `GET /api/auth/confirm?code=…` (PKCE — works only in the browser that requested the reset);
`?token_hash=…&type=recovery` is also handled, for a customised "Reset password" template. Redirect URLs must list
`/api/auth/confirm` (README); shared logic in `src/lib/services/password-reset.ts`.

## Commands

- `npm run dev` — dev server on Cloudflare workerd; secrets from `.dev.vars` (Node scripts read `.env`)
- `npm run build` — SSR build via `@astrojs/cloudflare`; run before any `wrangler` command
- `npx astro sync` — generates `.astro/` types; required once after a fresh clone or `npm run lint` fails with ~20 unresolved-type errors (CI runs it explicitly)
- `npm run lint` / `lint:fix` — ESLint (strictTypeChecked + Prettier as a lint rule: formatting errors fail lint)
- `npx supabase start` — local Supabase (Docker); Studio at http://localhost:54323
- `npm test` / `npm run test:watch` — Vitest unit tests (`src/**/*.test.ts`, node environment, plain config without
  Astro's Vite setup); one file: `npx vitest run src/lib/services/tag-validation/evaluate.test.ts`
- `npm run typecheck` — `astro check`
- `npm run test:e2e` — Playwright end-to-end test of the main path (`e2e/*.spec.ts`) against `npm run dev` on :4321;
  needs `E2E_EMAIL` / `E2E_PASSWORD` of a test account in `.dev.vars` (skipped without them); not run in CI

Wrangler (Worker `authenticheck`). Production deploys come from Workers Builds on `main`; CI never deploys.

- Agent-safe: `npm run build && npx wrangler versions upload --message "…" --preview-alias <name>`, `npx wrangler deploy --dry-run`, `npx wrangler deployments status`, `npx wrangler tail --format pretty --status error`
- Human-only: `npx wrangler deploy`, `npx wrangler rollback`, `npx wrangler secret put`, `wrangler login`, plan upgrades
- `dist/server/wrangler.json` is what deploys, not `wrangler.jsonc` — build first.
- `compatibility_date` ceiling is `2026-05-14` (pinned workerd); raise only with an adapter/wrangler upgrade.

Pre-commit (husky + lint-staged): `eslint --fix` on `*.{ts,tsx,astro}`, `prettier --write` on `*.{json,css,md}`.
CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs lint, type check, unit tests and build on push/PR to `main`, Node 22 (`.nvmrc` 22.14; local Node 24 also works).

## 10xDevs AI Toolkit - Module 3, Lesson 1

Open Module 3 by producing a **durable, risk-first quality contract** before any test is written — then drive each rollout phase through the standard change chain.

```
PRD + roadmap + archive
        │
        ▼
   /10x-test-plan  ──►  context/foundation/test-plan.md  (strategy §1–§5 frozen + cookbook §6 grows)
        │
        ▼  (one rollout phase at a time, /clear between handoffs)
   /10x-new ──► /10x-research ──► /10x-plan ──► /10x-implement
```

`/10x-test-plan` is a **stateful orchestrator**, not a one-shot generator. On first run it writes the phased rollout to `context/foundation/test-plan.md`. On every subsequent run it re-derives state from on-disk artifacts and presents the next handoff. The lesson focus is **strategy and rollout sequencing, not configuration**. Hooks, MCP servers, and CI YAML are configured in later lessons of this module.

### Task Router - Where to start

| Skill | Use it when |
| --- | --- |
| **Quality strategy as a rules-file (lesson focus)** | |
| `/10x-test-plan` | You have a PRD (and ideally a roadmap and a few archived slices) and you are about to write the project's first tests, or you noticed that AI-generated tests are landing on helpers while critical flows go uncovered. First invocation runs discovery (PRD + roadmap + archive + hot-spot scan), a 5-question user interview, and a synthesis pass with a mandatory challenger check, then writes `test-plan.md` in `context/foundation/` with a risk map (5–7 failure scenarios), a phased rollout table, a stack table, a quality-gates table, a cookbook section (`§6`, fills in as phases ship), and a negative-space section (what we deliberately don't test). Subsequent invocations advance the rollout one handoff at a time. |
| `/10x-test-plan --status` | A `test-plan.md` already exists and you want a compact snapshot of where the rollout stands — which phases are `not started`, `change opened`, `researched`, `planned`, `implementing`, or `complete`, and what the next action is. Does no work; safe to run any time. |
| `/10x-test-plan --refresh` | A `test-plan.md` already exists and one of: a new top-3 risk surfaced from the roadmap or archive, a tool's `checked:` date is older than three months, the project's tech stack changed, or §7 negative-space no longer matches what the team believes. Opens a new `test-plan-refresh-<YYYY-MM-DD>` change folder rather than editing the guide in place. |

### Rollout chain — what happens after the guide is written

The guide's §3 *Phased Rollout* table is the orchestrator's state. For each non-`complete` row the orchestrator selects the next handoff based on which artifacts exist in `context/changes/<change-id>/`:

| State on disk | Next handoff | Status transitions to |
| --- | --- | --- |
| change folder missing | `/10x-new <change-id>` | `change opened` |
| `change.md` only | `/10x-research` (with a risks-to-verify brief) | `researched` |
| `+ research.md` | `/10x-plan` (with cost × signal + cookbook-update constraints) | `planned` |
| `+ plan.md` with pending `## Progress` items | `/10x-implement <change-id> phase <N>` | `implementing` / `complete` |
| `+ plan.md` fully `[x]` | Mark §3 row `complete`; loop to next pending row | — |

Each handoff is a **STOP point**. The orchestrator copies the next command to the clipboard, asks the user to `/clear` and run it, then exits. Re-invoke `/10x-test-plan` (no arguments) to advance.

### Risk-first prioritization rules

- Risks are **failure scenarios in user / business terms**, not test names. "Logged-out user reaches paid content via stale token" is a risk; "test the login form" is not.
- 5 to 7 risks. Fewer is too coarse; more makes prioritization useless.
- Impact and likelihood are user/business ratings, not technical complexity.
- Every risk traces to a source: PRD section, archived slice, roadmap entry, Phase 2 interview question, hot-spot **directory** with churn count, or a tech-stack constraint. No invented risks.
- **Signal, not knowledge.** §2 cites *evidence that raised the risk*, never a file as "where the failure lives." File:line anchors, function names, schema names, and module names are forbidden in §2 — they belong in `/10x-research`'s output, produced per rollout phase against current code. The plan is a QA spec; it is not a code audit.
- Coverage is not the metric. **Risk coverage** is the metric.

### Dual-layer mapping rules

- Classic layer first: the cheapest test that gives a real signal wins. Promote to e2e only when no cheaper layer covers the risk.
- AI-native layer second, and only where it adds signal classic tests do not give cheaply.
- Every AI-native row has a **"When NOT to use"** line. If you cannot write one, drop the row.
- Every tool name carries a `checked: <YYYY-MM-DD>` date. Tool names are examples of the category, not endorsements.
- Both layers must be non-empty in the final guide if the project warrants them. Classic-only is a 2020 plan; AI-native-only is hype. AI-native phases are not mandatory — include them only when the brief justified them under cost × signal.

### Quality gates rules

- Required gates (lint, typecheck, unit+integration, e2e on critical flows) must map to actual CI steps. If a required gate is not yet wired, mark it as `required after §3 Phase <N>` and let the named rollout phase wire it.
- Post-edit hook is **recommended local**, not a CI substitute.
- Multimodal visual review is **selective**, applied to 1–3 critical screens, not to every page.
- Vision-driven fallback (Anthropic Computer Use or OpenAI CUA) is reserved for DOM-unreachable surfaces; expensive per action.

### Cookbook patterns (§6) — fills in over time

`test-plan.md` is both a phased strategy and a **growing cookbook**. §6 starts as placeholders (`TBD — see §3 Phase <N>`) and fills in incrementally — each rollout phase's plan ends with a sub-phase that updates the relevant §6 entry (location, naming, reference test, run command). After Module 3 completes, §6 becomes the canonical answer to "how do I add a test for X in this project?" — and is what `/10x-tdd` reads in Lesson 2.

### Lesson boundaries

- Do not write test code. That is Lesson 2 (`/10x-tdd` and unit-test authoring).
- Do not configure hooks, hook lifecycle, or debugging hooks. That is Lesson 3.
- Do not configure MCP servers, Playwright API, e2e code, or multimodal scenario code. That is Lesson 4.
- Do not run the bug-to-fix-to-regression-test workflow. That is Lesson 5.
- Do not author CI/CD pipelines from scratch or write GitHub Actions YAML. The guide names gates; configuration is owned by Module 1 Lesson 5 and Module 2 Lesson 5.
- Do not benchmark multimodal models. Cite criteria (cost, latency, agent-friendliness), never a ranking.
- Do not read the codebase for knowledge (call graphs, schemas, "which file owns this failure"). That is `/10x-research`'s job, per rollout phase.

### Paths used by this lesson

- `context/foundation/test-plan.md` — the quality contract produced and maintained by `/10x-test-plan`
- `context/foundation/prd.md` — primary risk source
- `context/foundation/roadmap.md` — likelihood weighting
- `context/foundation/tech-stack.md` — stack input (when present)
- `context/archive/<change-id>/plan.md` — implemented risk surface
- `context/changes/<change-id>/` — per-rollout-phase change folder (one per row in §3)
